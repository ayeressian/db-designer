# db_designer_pwa

Designer for relational databases.

It uses [db_designer_core](https://github.com/ayeressian/db_designer_core) web component to render designer view. 
This application based on PWA.
It's intended to be used by desktop computer.

To run:
  1. npm i
  2. npm start
  3. In chrome browser navigate to http://localhost:9999/src (If it did not load properly refresh. I am looking into resolving that bug)
  This project only works with chrome browser right now.
  4. After application has been loaded. Click on the three dot icon (top right of browser) and choose "install DB designer". Now you can launch the application as a standalone application.
